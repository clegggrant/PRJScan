Sentiment analysis has become a very useful tool in recent times for studying people’s opinions, sentiments and subjective evaluation of any event of social and economic relevance, and in particular, policy decisions. The present paper proposes a framework for sentiment analysis using twitter data for the ’demone- tization’ effort of the Government of India. The paper employs twitter data using Twitter API. The methodology of the paper involves collection of data from twitter from different cities of India using geolocation and preprocessing followed by a lexicon-based approach to analyse users’ sentiments over a period of ﬁve weeks preceding the policy announcement. In addition to this, the paper also attempts to analyse the sentiments of speciﬁc groups of people representing diverse interest groups. Keywords. Demonetization; data analysis; data preprocessing; opinion extraction; sentiment classiﬁcation; machine learning. 1. Introduction The recent ‘demonetization’ effort of the Government of India raised so much of hue and cry in terms of the attention it received from the media, academia and common people that no other policy had ever received in the post-inde- pendent India. The Prime Minister of India announced on 8th November, 2016 evening via media broadcast that 500 and 1000 denomination notes [1, 2] would cease to exist as legal tender with effect from the very next day [3, 4] (ac- tually from 12 am). The Gazette Notiﬁcation of the Min- istry of Finance dated 8th November came after the announcement of the Prime Minister. The Finance Ministry notiﬁcation stated that the policy measure was announced on the recommendation of the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank. However, from the very beginning, it was considered to be a favoured policy of the central government, in par- ticular the policy announcement was centred around fake currency and unaccounted wealth (black money in common parlance)1. The concern for the fake currency in circulation on the part the Prime Minister. The crux of *For correspondence of the government has been receiving greater attention in times2. Subsequently the RBI also endorsed the recent policy decision, and in its order dated 9th November it issued guidelines to banks for implementation of the policy of demonetization. The policy of demonetization led to the reduction of 86% of cash in circulation in value terms, which adversely impacted on the transaction capability of the public starting from the inability to pay for daily needs, such as food or emergency services, medical attention and business, thereby affecting economic growth in the medium and long run. There successful is no history of 1The Gazette of India Extraordinary, part II-Section 3-Sub-section (ii), Ministry of Finance (New Delhi: Controller of Publications, Govern- ment of India, and November 8, 2016). 2A joint study conducted by National Investigation Agency and Indian Statistical Institute estimates the value of fake currency notes to the tune of at least Rs. 4000 million between 2010–11 and 2014–15 (Rahul Tripathi, The Economic Times, November 15, 2016). Also see the replies to Lok Sabha Starred Question Number 41 on 18/11/2016, which puts the value of actual seizure of counterfeit notes between 2013 and September 2016 at Rs. 1550 million. Another Rajya Sabha Unstarred Question Number 3777 on 13th August 2014, Ministry of Home Affairs, reports that between 2011 and 30th June 2014 the total amount of seized currency notes is Rs. 838 million. The National Investigation Agency puts the value of fake currency notes at Rs. 160,000 million (The Indian Express, June 11, 2012). 186 Page 2 of 10 Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 implementation of demonetization in any other country. As a matter of fact Venezuela also announced a policy demonetization around a month after the Indian policy announcement, but was forced to withdraw within a few days after food riots and other violence rocked the country. In the past, Nigeria was also not successful in the imple- mentation of similar demonetization exercise. As for the unaccounted wealth in high denomination notes is con- cerned, it was pointed out that they are also part of the income generation process in the economy – The Informal Economy. The informal economy is very large in India like other developing economies both in terms of its share of national income as well as a source of employment. The informal economy is not registered (though there are dif- ferent layers of informality) and hence is not subject to regulations and is not in the tax net (direct or indirect). However, these informal activities cannot be grouped into the same category as drug, smuggling or human trafﬁcking. In this backdrop the policy announcement of demonetiza- tion assumes its importance to all segments of the society. From the very ﬁrst day after the announcement, electronic media [5, 6] and social networking sites were ﬂooded with debates and discussions on the issue. In academia, several critiques were published immediately after the policy announcement. For example, Rajakumar and Shetty [7], Lahiri [8], Nag [9], Reddy [10] and several articles in The Economist and other news magazines. Generally the arti- cles disputed the efﬁcacy of the policy and concluded that apart from the short-term problems faced by the public, GDP would be adversely affected in the medium and long run. However, some of the supporters of demonetization came up with the argument that the dip in income and growth would be temporary, but the policy shock would lead to expansion of banking practices by the public that would generate efﬁciency in the economic sphere in the country and extension of the tax net. Regarding the unex- pected policy shock, it was argued that in order to make the policy effective the Government or RBI did not have the option to implement the policy in a phased manner, because anticipated policy has limited effectiveness. Dasgupta [11], in a theoretical analysis, shows that the medium to long run [12, 13] effects do not look ’rosy’. It is further pointed out, based on Lucas (1997), that an unanticipated monetary contraction may lead to depression. Apart from academia or the policy makers, electronic media and social networking sites were rocked with the discussion with policy decision from the very ﬁrst day. In recent years, big on-line social media data have found many applications in the intersec- tion of social science, statistics and computer science. Text categorization was started long time ago (Salton and McGill, 1983); however [14, 15], categorization based on sentiment was introduced more recently in Das and Chen (2001), Morinaga et al (2002), Pang et al (2002), Tong (2001), Turney (2002) and Wiebe (2000), and it has spread from computer science to management sciences (Archak, Ghose and Ipeirotis 2007; Chen and Xie 2008; Das and Chen 2007; Dellarocas, Zhang and Awad 2007 Ghose, Ipeirotis and Sundararajan 2007; Hu, Pavlou and Zhang 2006; Park, Lee and Han 2007). In 2012, Federico Neri Carlo et al had developed an idea of sentimental analysis using 1000 Facebook posts [16, 17] about new casts, comparing the [18, 19] sentiments for the Italian public broadcasting service – towards the emerging and most dynamic private companies. In 2015, Xing Fang et al pre- sented an idea of sentiment analysis using product review data [8, 20]. His main aim was to tackle the problem [21, 22] of sentiment polarity categorization of sentiments analysis [23, 24]. Despite the fact that social media data cover only a limited segment of the population of a country, especially in India with very little access of the common people to Internet and smart phone, it captures the mood of the population in some way. There are 292 million users of social network sites in India; the corresponding ﬁgure for US is 207 million, and 564 million in China (Source: Sta- tista, 2017)3. In per capita terms, Indian social media penetration is way behind China or USA (half and one third, respectively); nonetheless, the absolute number itself is very large. The present paper aims to analyse the impact of the demonetization effort on the common people as well as the opinions of different groups of people or organiza- tion, such as economists, politicians, industry and banking sector, etc. Our analysis is based on tweets, which is very popular in the on-line social media platform. A large number of tweets were collected from the twitter by Twitter API [25, 26] using different keywords related to demone- tization in different major cities of India within a particular time period, date and geographical location. The tweets were categorized into positive, negative or neutral opinion [27] to estimate the overall sentiment of people on the current situation. With this introduction the paper is orga- nized as follows. Section 2 provides the methodology, section 3 presents the empirical ﬁndings and analysis of the sentiments and the last section concludes. 2. Sentiment analysis methodology: background There are several approaches for sentiment analysis, of which lexical approach and supervised approach or machine learning approach has been used here. 2.1 Score evaluation method using SentiWordnet Extraction of sentiment for a particular tweet is executed as ternary sentiments – positive, negative or neutral. This is obtained by the following scoring method. Here, Sen- tiWordnet is used for polarity detection. SentiWordnet is the result of the automatic annotation of all the synsets of 3https://www.statista.com/statistics/278341/number-of-social-net work-users-in-selected-countries (as on 10.07.2017). Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 Page 3 of 10 186 WORDNET according to the notions of positive negative and neutral to three numerical scores Pos(s), Neg(s) and Obj(s) associated with each synset [3, 28]. After pre- processing of tweets, each tweets token has been parsed with the help of POS tagger. POS tagger assigns a tag [29] to each token and then the word is passed in Sen- tiWordnet to check the score as well as polarity of that particular word. SentiWordnet will return the sentiment- type of the seven possible categories strong-positive, positive, weak-positive, neutral, weak-negative, negative and strong-negative words [30, 31]. Now the number of positive (pos_count) and number of negative (neg_count) adjectives in each sentence have been counted. If the neg_count is an ODD number then the sentence is con- sidered ‘‘Negative’’ and if If the neg_count is an EVEN number then the sentence is considered ‘‘Positive’’. If a word in the tweet is found to be unknown then it is matched with the dictionary containing acronym words and replaced with the proper words, and the same scoring method is performed as before. Let Score St be the Number of Positive Words Match Number of Negative Words Match. Let C be the set of cities from where tweets are collected for the event, and T be the set of tweets collected from a city c 2 C for the event on a particular date. Also deﬁne each tweet t 2 T to carry a score St ð0 [ ¼ St [ 0Þ, such that if St [ 0 then the tweet shows full support of the event demonetization. If St\0 then the tweet shows no support of the event demonetization. Then, for city c, its approval score (positive, negative or neutral) can be deﬁned as follows: X St jTj : t2T ð1Þ We represent the scoring of all the cities with the date in ﬁgures 1 and 2. Averaging over all cities in C, the average tweet leaning for event demonetization is X X X ¼ 1 jCj St jTj : c2C t2T ð2Þ 2.2 Sentiment analysis by machine learning method Machine learning is one of the most prominent techniques, gaining the interest of researchers [16, 20] due to its adaptability and accuracy [32]. This method also involves three stages, viz. data collection, preprocessing and training data classiﬁcation and plotting of results [11, 33]. A common algorithm employed in the machine learning approach is the Naı¨ve-Bayes classiﬁer [34, 35], which is a simple classiﬁcation of words based on the Bayes theorem. It is a Bag of words approach for subjective analysis of t n u o c 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 600 400 200 0 −2 0 2 score A h m e d a b a B a n g a u r u l C h e n n a i D e h l i H y d e r a b a d l k o k a t a M u m b a i P u n e city Ahmedabad Bangaluru Chennai Delhi Hyderabad kolkata Mumbai Pune Figure 1.

By the Naı¨ve-Bayes theorem Pðdj=ciÞPðciÞ PðdjÞ ð3Þ where P(dj) is the probability that a randomly picked document d contains vector dj. P(ci) is the probability that a randomly picked document belongs to class ci. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer is also used here for classiﬁcation. Classiﬁcation is done by construct- ing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space [36, 37] that separates cases of different class labels. SVM supports both regression and classiﬁcation tasks and can handle multiple continuous and categorical variables. 2.3 Parts of speech (Pos) tagging Pos tagging is a form of annotating text where part of speech is assigned to each word. The part of speech tagger marks tokens with their corresponding word type based on the token itself and the context of the token. 186 Page 4 of 10 Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 t n u o c 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 2000 1500 1000 500 0 −4 −2 0 score 2 A h m e d a b a B a n g a u r u l C h e n n a i D e h l i H y d e r a b a d l k o k a t a M u m b a i P u n e city Ahmedabad Bangaluru Chennai Delhi Hyderabad kolkata Mumbai Pune Figure 2. Comparative scores of eight cities at second phase (14.12.16). Part-of-speech tags are assigned to character strings. Part-of-speech or word categorization is the grammatical nature or category of a lexical item. For example, every term has been associated with a relevant tag indicating its role in the sentence, such as VBZ (verb), NN (noun), JJ (adjective), etc. 3. Material and methods 3.1 Data collection Table 1 contains a brief description of total number of tweets and re-tweets with proper keywords. In our choice the most important keyword is demonetization. To capture the same context, some additional keywords, viz. black money, cash clean-up [33, 38], etc. are included. Using these keywords, totally 57536 tweets are downloaded sep- arately from eight major Indian cities between 08/11/2016 and 14/12/2016 using Twitter API [7, 39]. 3.2 Data preprocessing method After collecting data, they are preprocessed [40]. The pre- processing step is used to handle the following issues: (i) removing punctuations, (ii) cleaning text – removal of non-alphanumeric characters from the text, (iii) removing URLs and un-necessary white spaces and tabs, etc., (iv) stop-word removal – i.e., words that do connecting function in the sentence, such as prepositions, articles, etc. and (V) convert to lower case. 3.3 Score analysis After data preprocessing is completed, the Stanford POS tagger is used to tag the dataset with its parts of speech and the tagged documents are fed as input to SentiWordNet for scoring positive, negative and neutral terms. 3.3a City-wise sentiment score analysis: First the frequency of sentiment scores has been calculated from the tweets set of eight major cities immediately after the policy decision was announced on November 8, 2016 and after about ﬁve weeks, on December 14, 2016, when the impact of initial shock is expected to die down and general population adjusts to the new policy regime (ﬁg- ures 1 and 2).

The supporting group of the economists is known to be close to the current government at the centre and part of the policy making body and the opposing group is known for their allegiance to the previous government led by Congress Party (oppose demonetization). r e b m u n 600 400 200 0 6 1 / 8 0 / 1 1 6 1 / 2 1 / 1 1 6 1 / 6 1 / 1 1 6 1 / 0 2 / 1 1 6 1 / 4 2 / 1 1 6 1 / 8 2 / 1 1 6 1 / 2 0 / 2 1 6 1 / 6 0 / 2 1 6 1 / 0 1 / 2 1 6 1 / 4 1 / 2 1 created tweet negative neutral positive Figure 5.

In this method the unigrams which are found in the lexicon [41, 42] are assigned a polarity score. Tweets are analysed and compared to the following categories of emotion: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise. Among the emotions, as classiﬁed by the Naı¨ve-Bayes method the most important sentiment is reported to be ’disgust’ followed by ’anger’. Together with the occurrence of other emotions it readily follows that on the whole, public emotions did not favour the policy announcement. 3.3e Package used: Packages and other details that are used in this analysis are as follows. a) R software has been used as the computational envi- ronment and some of the packages that have been used are TwitteR, ggplot2, NLP, Tm, etc. b) SentiWordNet: The SentiWordNet is a lexical resource associated with two numerical scores ranging from 0 to 1 that indicate Pos(s) and Neg(s), describing how positive or negative terms are contained in the synsets. Here SentiWordNet is used for document level senti- ment classiﬁcation using the polarity dataset of different cities and groups. c) To train the model we use the Naı¨ve-Bayes function [43] from the e1071 package. d) Here we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as the Stanford CoreNLP [17, 44] for POS tagging. e) The following Acronym Dictionary (table 2) is used. 4. Result and analysis The methodology for the analysis of sentiments described in the previous section has been used to analyse sentiments in a number of ways – sentiment analysis for initial impact and after some time, across cities, for the whole period across cities, for speciﬁc groups, etc. Tweets have been collected in two phases: ﬁrst phase after the policy decision was announced on November 8, 2016 and the second phase 15 39 25 20.6 50 54.6 70 65 tweet negative neutral positive 186 Page 6 of 10 Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 Table 3.

Next the senti- ment scores for each of the eight cities over the period of the day from 08 / 11 / 2016 to 14 / 12 / 2016 have been calculated (ﬁgures 3–5). There are huge differences in sentiment scores across cities over this period. From the analysis, ﬂuctuation of opinion per day has been observed. During the immediate post-demonetization days, typically the ﬁrst two weeks, there were large variations across the three types of senti- ments. In general, frequency of tweets decreased from the second week until around 06/12/2016; then we can ﬁnd a sudden spurt in tweets sentiments. Only in the case of Bengaluru, frequency of tweets shows a steady decline where the neutral score is marginally higher. Delhi shows large ﬂuctuations to begin with, a reversal in the interme- diate days and ﬁnally closes with a positive mark. Kolkata shows dominance of neutral sentiments in the initial days until 06/12/2016 when all the three types show a tendency of convergence, but closes with a higher neutral sentiment. Now sentiments of different groups, viz., Group of Economists, Industries Group, Political Group and Bank Group are analysed within the time period of 08/11/ 2016–14/12/2016 (ﬁgures 6–10). Economists and politi- cians are divided into two groups: one supporting demon- etization and other opposing it. Reactions of different banks related to this policy are also analysed. It has been observed that for bank group, there is a mixed reaction of positive, negative and neutral sentiments and industries group has neutral sentiment. 4.1 Visualization and quantiﬁcation of frequency of words of relevance In order to get an idea of the people’s perception about the impact of the speciﬁc event of demonetization on the economy and society, top 5 frequencies of speciﬁc words of relevance for each group (table 4) are analysed here and visualized with the word cloud of different cities (ﬁgures 6– 10).

Here, testing has been done on number positive and number of negative tweets of four groups over the span of two months (08/11/2016–14/12/2016). One-way ANOVA is used for the group analysis and the results are presented in tables 6 and 7. Here, in table 6, sum square and mean square are used to calculate the F value; from the F chart, the F ratio (3, 36) (3 across, 36 down) has been obtained. These numbers come from the Df (degrees of freedom) column. From the chart it 186 Page 8 of 10 Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 Table 6. Analysis of variance table for positive tweets.

Our F value is 7.5446 for positive score and 8.7179 for negative score of four groups, which is more than 2.87. This means our ANOVA test proves signiﬁcance. Most standard signiﬁ- cance tests use 0.1 or 0.05 as a value to shoot for. Our p- value is 0.0004856 for positive score and 0.0001766 for negative score of four groups. Hence, our p-values come under this value. Hence, we deﬁnitely found proof of variance. Now, comparison of different groups can be visualized using Box plots (ﬁgures 12 and 13). To conﬁrm our one-way Anova, we have done one more test, i.e., homogeneity of variance (Brown Forsyth) test. The p-value here is 0.13 and 0.24 for positive and negative score of four groups, respectively, which is above normal signiﬁcance levels of 0.10 and 0.05 (tables 8 and 9). Hence, this means there is no reason to disclaim our F-test. G1 G2 G3 G4 Figure 13. Visualization comparison of different groups with respect to negative score of four groups G1–G4 using Box plots.

The classiﬁcation performance is evaluated in terms of three measures: precision (P), recall (R) and F- measure based on the numbers of true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). Precision can be deﬁned as TP/(TP ? FP), recall = TP/(TP ? FN) and F- measure or balanced F-score = 2(precision  recall)/(pre- cision ? recall). Results are shown in table 10. The pre- diction accuracy of a classiﬁcation model is 70% for Naı¨ve Bayes and 79% for SVM. 4.3b Calculating citywide correlation matrix: After calculating city-wise total score per day from 08/11/ 2016 to 14/12/2016, a co-relation coefﬁcient matrix among the scores of eight cities has been calculated (table 11), which indicates how accurate the sentiment classiﬁcation is, and it shows to what degree the ﬂuctuation patterns of a sentiment are predicted by the model. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have tried to implement a dictionary- based methodology of sentiment analysis and analysed large amount of data to estimate the tweet sentiment of the public in the aftermath of the recent ’demonetization’ drive of the central government. We employed document level analysis based on our own approach, which helped infer opinion and sentiment of people of different cities over a ﬁve-week period. It is readily observed that while the sentiments vary across cities over time or across interest groups, the impact dies down during the latter part of the period under consideration. While the academia and print media reported concern about the adverse impact on GDP and growth rate, bias against the poor, informal sector and agriculture, the tweets of the different groups do not conform to this view, and the relevant words are seldom shown up in the tweets. The concern of the ruling political group also does not conform to the primary agenda as described in the Gazette Notiﬁcation. This method is applicable to other areas also, e.g., socio-po- litical events, customer review for public utility services, such as airlines or railways, etc., which immediately raise public sentiments. 1 –0.3176 0.0556 –0.1393 –0.0127 1 0.4892 0.4309 –0.6136 Acknowledgements 1 0.1585 –0.3617 1 –0.5577 Das acknowledges the support from CSE-CSSSC Research Project on Capital Market funded by Calcutta Stock Exchange.
