The present paper proposes a framework for sentiment analysis using twitter data for the ’demone-tization’ effort of the Government of India. The paper employs twitter data using Twitter API. The methodologyof  the  paper  involves  collection  of  data  from  twitter  from  different  cities  of  India  using  geolocation  andpreprocessing followed by a lexicon-based approach to analyse users’ sentiments over a period of five weekspreceding  the  policy  announcement.  In  addition  to  this,  the  paper  also  attempts  to  analyse  the  sentiments  ofspecific groups of people representing diverse interest groups.Keywords.Demonetization; data analysis; data preprocessing; opinion extraction; sentiment classification;machine learning.1. IntroductionThe  recent  ‘demonetization’  effort  of  the  Government  ofIndia raised so much of hue and cry in terms of the attentionit received from the media, academia and common peoplethat  no  other  policy  had  ever  received  in  the  post-inde-pendent India. The Prime Minister of India announced on8th November, 2016 evening via media broadcast that 500and 1000 denomination notes [1, 2] would cease to exist aslegal tender with effect from the very next day [3, 4] (ac-tually  from  12  am).  The  Gazette  Notification  of  the  Min-istry   of   Finance   dated   8th   November   came   after   theannouncement of the Prime Minister. The Finance Ministrynotification stated that the  policy  measure was announcedon the recommendation of the Central Board of Directors ofthe  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI),  the  country’s  centralbank. However, from the very beginning, it was consideredto be a favoured policy of the central government, in par-ticular   the   Prime   Minister.   The   crux   of   the   policyannouncement   was   centred   around   fake   currency   andunaccounted  wealth  (black  money  in  common  parlance)1.The concern for the fake currency in circulation on the partof  the  government  has  been  receiving  greater  attention  inrecent  times2.  Subsequently  the  RBI  also  endorsed  thepolicy  decision,  and  in  its  order  dated  9th  November  itissued guidelines to banks for implementation of the policyof demonetization. The policy of demonetization led to thereduction  of  86%  of  cash  in  circulation  in  value  terms,which  adversely impacted  on the transaction capability  ofthe public starting from the inability to pay for daily needs,such as food or emergency services, medical attention andbusiness, thereby affecting economic growth in the mediumand    long    run.    There    is    no    history    of    successful*For correspondence1The Gazette of India Extraordinary, part II-Section 3-Sub-section (ii),Ministry of Finance (New Delhi: Controller of Publications, Govern-ment of India, and November 8, 2016).2A joint study conducted by National Investigation Agency and IndianStatistical Institute estimates the value of fake currency  notes to thetune  of  at  least  Rs.  4000  million  between  2010–11  and  2014–15(Rahul Tripathi, The Economic Times, November 15, 2016). Also seethe replies to Lok Sabha Starred Question Number 41 on 18/11/2016,which  puts  the  value  of  actual  seizure  of  counterfeit  notes  between2013 and September 2016 at Rs. 1550 million. Another Rajya SabhaUnstarred Question Number 3777 on 13th August 2014, Ministry ofHome Affairs, reports that between 2011 and 30th June 2014 the totalamount  of  seized  currency  notes  is  Rs.  838  million.  The  NationalInvestigation  Agency  puts  the  value  of  fake  currency  notes  at  Rs.160,000 million (The Indian Express, June 11, 2012).Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 ÓIndian Academy of Scienceshttps://doi.org/10.1007/s12046-018-0949-0Sadhana(0123456789().,-volV)FT3](0123456789().,-volV)implementation of demonetization in any other country. Asa   matter   of   fact   Venezuela   also   announced   a   policydemonetization  around  a  month  after  the  Indian  policyannouncement,  but  was  forced  to  withdraw  within  a  fewdays after food riots and other violence rocked the country.In  the  past,  Nigeria  was  also  not  successful  in  the  imple-mentation  of  similar  demonetization  exercise.  As  for  theunaccounted  wealth  in  high  denomination  notes  is  con-cerned,  it  was  pointed  out  that  they  are  also  part  of  theincome generation process in the economy – The InformalEconomy. The informal economy is very large in India likeother  developing  economies  both  in  terms  of  its  share  ofnational  income  as  well  as  a  source  of  employment.  Theinformal  economy  is  not  registered  (though  there  are  dif-ferent  layers  of  informality)  and  hence  is  not  subject  toregulations  and  is  not  in  the  tax  net  (direct  or  indirect).However, these informal activities cannot be grouped intothe same category as drug, smuggling or human trafficking.In this backdrop the policy  announcement of demonetiza-tion assumes its importance to all segments of the society.From the very first day after the announcement, electronicmedia [5,6] and social networking sites were flooded withdebates and discussions on the issue. In academia, severalcritiques   were   published   immediately   after   the   policyannouncement.  For  example,  Rajakumar  and  Shetty  [7],Lahiri [8], Nag [9], Reddy [10] and several articles in TheEconomist  and  other  news  magazines.  Generally  the  arti-cles disputed the efficacy of the policy and concluded thatapart  from  the  short-term  problems  faced  by  the  public,GDP would be adversely affected in the medium and longrun.  However,  some  of  the  supporters  of  demonetizationcame  up  with  the  argument  that  the  dip  in  income  andgrowth  would  be  temporary,  but  the  policy  shock  wouldlead  to  expansion  of  banking  practices  by  the  public  thatwould  generate  efficiency  in  the  economic  sphere  in  thecountry and extension of the tax net. Regarding the unex-pected policy shock, it was argued that in order to make thepolicy  effective  the  Government  or  RBI  did  not  have  theoption to implement the policy in a phased manner, becauseanticipated policy has limited effectiveness. Dasgupta [11],in a theoretical analysis, shows that the medium to long run[12,13] effects do not look ’rosy’. It is further pointed out,based  on  Lucas  (1997),  that  an  unanticipated  monetarycontraction may lead to depression. Apart from academia orthe policy makers, electronic media and social networkingsites were rocked with the discussion with policy decisionfrom the very first day. In recent years, big on-line socialmedia  data  have  found  many  applications  in  the  intersec-tion of social science, statistics and computer science. Textcategorization   was   started   long   time   ago   (Salton   andMcGill,  1983);  however  [14,15],  categorization  based  onsentiment  was  introduced  more  recently  in  Das  and  Chen(2001),  Morinagaet al(2002),  Panget al(2002),  Tong(2001), Turney (2002) and Wiebe (2000), and it has spreadfrom  computer  science  to  management  sciences  (Archak,Ghose  and  Ipeirotis  2007;  Chen  and  Xie  2008;  Das  andChen  2007;  Dellarocas,  Zhang  and  Awad  2007  Ghose,Ipeirotis  and  Sundararajan  2007;  Hu,  Pavlou  and  Zhang2006;  Park,  Lee  and  Han  2007).  In  2012,  Federico  NeriCarloet alhad developed an  idea  of  sentimental  analysisusing  1000  Facebook  posts  [16,17]  about  new  casts,comparing  the  [18,19]  sentiments  for  the  Italian  publicbroadcasting  service  –  towards  the  emerging  and  mostdynamic private companies. In 2015, Xing Fanget alpre-sented an idea of sentiment analysis using product reviewdata  [8,20].  His  main  aim  was  to  tackle  the  problem[21,22] of sentiment polarity categorization of sentimentsanalysis  [23,24].  Despite  the  fact  that  social  media  datacover only a limited segment of the population of a country,especially  in  India  with  very  little  access  of  the  commonpeople to Internet and smart phone, it captures the mood ofthe population in some way. There are 292 million users ofsocial  network  sites  in India;  the  corresponding  figure  forUS is 207 million, and 564 million in China (Source: Sta-tista,  2017)3.  In  per  capita  terms,  Indian  social  mediapenetration  is  way  behind  China  or  USA  (half  and  onethird, respectively); nonetheless, the absolute number itselfis very large. The present paper aims to analyse the impactof the demonetization effort on the common people as wellas the  opinions  of different  groups  of people  or organiza-tion, such as economists, politicians, industry and bankingsector, etc. Our analysis is based on tweets, which is verypopular  in  the  on-line  social  media  platform.  A  largenumber of tweets were collected from the twitter by TwitterAPI [25,26] using different keywords related  to demone-tization in different major cities of India within a particulartime  period,  date  and  geographical  location.  The  tweetswere categorized into positive, negative or neutral opinion[27]  to  estimate  the  overall  sentiment  of  people  on  thecurrent situation. With this introduction the paper is orga-nized  as  follows.  Section2provides  the  methodology,section3presents the empirical findings and analysis of thesentiments and the last section concludes.2. Sentiment analysis methodology: backgroundThere  are  several  approaches  for  sentiment  analysis,  ofwhich   lexical   approach   and   supervised   approach   ormachine learning approach has been used here.2.1Score evaluation method using SentiWordnetExtraction of sentiment for a particular tweet is executed asternary  sentiments  –  positive,  negative  or  neutral.  This  isobtained  by  the  following  scoring  method.  Here,  Sen-tiWordnet  is  used  for  polarity  detection.  SentiWordnet  isthe result of the automatic annotation of all the synsets of3https://www.statista.com/statistics/278341/number-of-social-network-users-in-selected-countries(as on 10.07.2017). 186 Page 2 of 10Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 WORDNET according to the notions of positive negativeand neutral to three numerical scores Pos(s), Neg(s) andObj(s)  associated  with  each  synset  [3,28].  After  pre-processing of tweets, each tweets token has been parsedwith  the  help  of  POS  tagger.  POS  tagger  assigns  a  tag[29]  to  each  token  and  then  the  word  is  passed  in  Sen-tiWordnet to check the score as well as polarity of thatparticular word. SentiWordnet will return the sentiment-type  of  the  seven  possible  categories  strong-positive,positive, weak-positive, neutral, weak-negative, negativeand strong-negative words [30,31]. Now the number ofpositive (pos_count) and number of negative (neg_count)adjectives  in  each  sentence  have  been  counted.  If  theneg_count is an ODD number then the sentence is con-sidered ‘‘Negative’’ and if If the neg_count is an EVENnumber then the sentence is considered ‘‘Positive’’. If aword  in  the  tweet  is  found  to  be  unknown  then  it  ismatched  with  the  dictionary  containing  acronym  wordsand replaced with the proper words, and the same scoringmethod is performed as before.Let   Score   St   be   the   Number   of   Positive   WordsMatchNumber of Negative Words Match. Let C be theset  of  cities  from  where  tweets  are  collected  for  theevent,  and  T  be  the  set  of  tweets  collected  from  a  cityc2Cfor the event on a particular date. Also define eachtweett2Tto carry a score Stð0[¼St[0Þ,suchthatifSt[0 then the tweet shows full support of the eventdemonetization. IfSt\0 then the tweet shows no supportof the event demonetization.Then, for city c, its approvalscore  (positive,  negative  or  neutral)  can  be  defined  asfollows:Xt2TStjTj:ð1ÞWe  represent the scoring of all the  cities  with  the  date infigures1and2. Averaging over all cities in C, the averagetweet leaning for event demonetization isX¼1jCjXc2CXt2TStjTj:ð2Þ2.2Sentiment analysis by machine learningmethodMachine learning is one of the most prominent techniques,gaining  the  interest  of  researchers  [16,20]  due  to  itsadaptability and accuracy [32]. This method also involvesthree stages, viz. data collection, preprocessing and trainingdata classification and plotting of results [11,33].A common algorithm employed in the machine learningapproach is the Naı ̈ve-Bayes classifier [34,35], which is asimple classification of words based on the Bayes theorem.It  is  a  Bag  of  words  approach  for  subjective  analysis  ofcontent. Naı ̈ve  Bayes  assigns  a  documentdjto a classci.By the Naı ̈ve-Bayes theoremPðdj=ciÞPðciÞPðdjÞð3ÞwhereP(dj)  is  the  probability  that  a  randomly  pickeddocumentdcontains vectordj.P(ci) is the probability that arandomly picked document belongs to classci.Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  classifier  is  also  usedhere for classification. Classification is done by construct-ing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space [36,37] thatseparates cases of different class labels. SVM supports bothregression and classification tasks and can handle multiplecontinuous and categorical variables.2.3Parts of speech (Pos) taggingPos  tagging  is  a  form  of  annotating  text  where  part  ofspeech  is  assigned  to  each  word.  The  part  of  speechtagger marks tokens with their corresponding word typebased  on  the  token  itself  and  the  context  of  the  token.AhmedabaBangaluruChennaiDelhiHyderabadkolkataMumbaiPune−2    0202004006000200400600020040060002004006000200400600020040060002004006000200400600scorecountcityAhmedabadBangaluruChennaiDelhiHyderabadkolkataMumbaiPuneFigure 1.Comparative   scores   of   eight   cities   at   first   phase(08.11.16).Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 Page 3 of 10 186 Part-of-speech  tags  are  assigned  to  character  strings.Part-of-speech or word categorization is the grammaticalnature or category of a lexical item. For example, everyterm has been associated with a relevant tag indicating itsrole in the sentence, such as VBZ (verb), NN (noun), JJ(adjective), etc.3. Material and methods3.1Data collectionTable1contains  a  brief  description  of  total  number  oftweets  and  re-tweets  with  proper keywords.  In our  choicethe most important keyword is demonetization. To capturethe  same  context,  some  additional  keywords,  viz.  blackmoney,  cash  clean-up  [33,38],  etc.  are  included.  Usingthese keywords, totally 57536 tweets are downloaded sep-arately from eight major Indian cities between 08/11/2016and 14/12/2016 using Twitter API [7,39].3.2Data preprocessing methodAfter collecting data, they are preprocessed [40]. The pre-processing  step  is  used  to  handle  the  following  issues:(i)  removing  punctuations,  (ii)  cleaning  text  –  removal  ofnon-alphanumeric  characters  from  the  text,  (iii)  removingURLs  and  un-necessary  white  spaces  and  tabs,  etc.,  (iv)stop-word removal – i.e., words that do connecting functionin  the  sentence,  such  as  prepositions,  articles,  etc.  and(V) convert to lower case.3.3Score analysisAfter  data  preprocessing  is  completed,  the  Stanford  POStagger is used to tag the dataset with its parts of speech andthe tagged documents are fed as input to SentiWordNet forscoring positive, negative and neutral terms.3.3aCity-wise sentiment score analysis:First the frequency of sentiment scores has been calculatedfrom the tweets set of eight major cities immediately afterthe  policy  decision  was  announced  on  November  8,  2016and  after  about  five  weeks,  on  December  14,  2016,  whenthe  impact  of  initial  shock  is  expected  to  die  down  andgeneral  population  adjusts  to  the  new  policy  regime  (fig-ures1and2).AhmedabaBangaluruChennaiDelhiHyderabadkolkataMumbaiPune−4   −2    0205001000150020000500100015002000050010001500200005001000150020000500100015002000050010001500200005001000150020000500100015002000scorecountcityAhmedabadBangaluruChennaiDelhiHyderabadkolkataMumbaiPuneFigure 2.Comparative  scores  of  eight  cities  at  second  phase(14.12.16).Table 1.Daily tweet collection from date 08/11/16 to 14/12/16 using proper keywords.DateHashTagCitiesTotal tweets collected08/11/16–14/12/16Ahmedabad3467#Demonetization,#demonetised,Bengaluru5886#demonetizing,#demonetise,Chennai6336#demonetizationsaveslife,Delhi16494#DemonetizationDisaster,Hyderabad8283#DemonetizationResponse,Kolkata7232#SupportDemonetization,Mumbai5792#blackMoneycleanup,Pune4046#DeMonetizationMess,Total57536#demonetizationaffected,#demonetizationmythsbusted,#Demonetization,#CashCleanUp 186 Page 4 of 10Sådhanå (2018) 43:186 3.3bSentiment analysis across date:Next the sentiment scores for each of the eight cities overthe  period  of  time  have  been  analysed  and  the  aggregatecounts  plotted  for  the  three  types  of  sentiment  scores  –positive, negative and neutral on each day between 08/11/2016 and 14/12/2016 (figures3–5).3.3cSentiment analysis for different groups:For the Group of Economists and Politicians, tweets havebeen collected separately from the supporting and opposinggroups,  resulting  into  two  panels  for  these  groups.  Thesupporting group of the economists is known to be close tothe current government at the centre and part of the policymaking  body  and  the  opposing  group  is  known  for  theirallegiance  to  the  previous  government  led  by  CongressParty (oppose demonetization).3.3dComputation of sentiments with machine learningmethod:Here  the Naı ̈ve-Bayes Classifier has  been used  to classifysentiment  of  people  of  different  cities,  trained  on  CarloStrapparava and Alessandro Valituttis emotions lexicon. Inthis  method  the  unigrams  which  are  found  in  the  lexicon[41,42] are assigned a polarity score. Tweets are analysedand  compared  to  the  following  categories  of  emotion:anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise.Among  the  emotions,  as  classified  by  the  Naı ̈ve-Bayesmethod  the  most  important  sentiment  is  reported  to  be’disgust’ followed by ’anger’. Together with the occurrenceof  other  emotions  it  readily  follows  that  on  the  whole,public emotions did not favour the policy announcement.3.3ePackage used:Packages and other details that are used in this analysis areas follows.a)  R  software  has  been  used  as  the  computational  envi-ronment and some of the packages that have been usedare TwitteR, ggplot2, NLP, Tm, etc.b)  SentiWordNet: The SentiWordNet is a lexical resourceassociated with two numerical scores ranging from 0 to1   that   indicate   Pos(s)   and   Neg(s),   describing   howpositive or negative terms are contained in the synsets.Here  SentiWordNet  is  used  for  document  level  senti-ment classification using the polarity dataset of differentcities and groups.c)  To  train  the  model  we  use  the  Naı ̈ve-Bayes  function[43] from the e1071 package.d)  Here   we   use   Natural   Language   Processing   (NLP)libraries  such  as  the  Stanford  CoreNLP  [17,44]  forPOS tagging.e)  The following Acronym Dictionary (table2) is used.4. Result and analysisThe methodology for the analysis of sentiments describedin the previous section has been used to analyse sentimentsin a number of ways – sentiment analysis for initial impactand  after  some  time,  across  cities,  for  the  whole  periodacross  cities,  for  specific  groups,  etc.  Tweets  have  beencollected in two phases: first phase after the policy decisionwas announced on November 8, 2016 and the second phase025050075011/08/1611/12/1611/16/1611/20/1611/24/1611/28/1612/02/1612/06/1612/10/1612/14/16creatednumbertweetnegativeneutralpositiveFigure 3.Sentiment  analysis  day-wise  of  some  major  cities:Bengaluru (08/11/2016–14/12/2016).05001000150011/08/1611/12/1611/16/1611/20/1611/24/1611/28/1612/02/1612/06/1612/10/1612/14/16creatednumbertweetnegativeneutralpositiveFigure 4.Sentiment  analysis  day-wise  of  some  major  cities:Delhi (08th Nov.–14th Dec. 2016).020040060011/08/1611/12/1611/16/1611/20/1611/24/1611/28/1612/02/1612/06/1612/10/1612/14/16creatednumbertweetnegativeneutralpositiveFigure 5.Sentiment  analysis  day-wise  of  some  major  cities:Kolkata (08th Nov.–14th Dec. 2016).Table 2.Typical example of acronym and their expansion.AcronymEnglish expressiongr8,gr8tGreatlolLaughing out loudrotfRolling on the floorbffBest friend foreverSådhanå (2018) 43:186 Page 5 of 10 186 after five weeks, on December 14, 2016, and the scores ofall the eight cities are compared (table3). Next the senti-ment scores for each of the eight cities over the period ofthe  day  from  08 / 11 / 2016  to  14 / 12 / 2016  have  beencalculated (figures3–5).There  are  huge  differences  in  sentiment  scores  acrosscities  over  this  period.  From  the  analysis,  fluctuation  ofopinion per day has been observed. During the immediatepost-demonetization  days,  typically  the  first  two  weeks,there were large variations across the three types of senti-ments. In general, frequency of tweets decreased from thesecond week  until  around  06/12/2016; then  we can  find asudden  spurt  in  tweets  sentiments.  Only  in  the  case  ofBengaluru,  frequency  of  tweets  shows  a  steady  declinewhere the neutral score is marginally higher. Delhi showslarge fluctuations to begin with, a reversal in the interme-diate days and finally closes with a positive mark. Kolkatashows  dominance  of neutral  sentiments  in the  initial  daysuntil 06/12/2016 when all the three types show a tendencyof convergence, but closes with a higher neutral sentiment.Now   sentiments   of   different   groups,   viz.,   Group   ofEconomists,  Industries  Group,  Political  Group  and  BankGroup   are   analysed   within   the   time   period   of   08/11/2016–14/12/2016  (figures6–10).  Economists  and  politi-cians are divided into two groups: one supporting demon-etization and other opposing it.Reactions  of  different  banks  related  to  this  policy  arealso  analysed.  It  has  been  observed  that  for  bank  group,there is a mixed reaction of positive, negative and neutralsentiments and industries group has neutral sentiment.4.1Visualization and quantification of frequencyof words of relevanceIn order to get an idea of the people’s perception about theimpact  of  the  specific  event  of  demonetization  on  theeconomy and society, top 5 frequencies of specific words ofrelevance  for  each  group  (table4)  are  analysed  here  andvisualized with the word cloud of different cities (figures6–10).

OurFvalue  is7.5446 for positive score and 8.7179 for negative score offour  groups,  which  is  more  than  2.87.  This  means  ourANOVA  test  proves  significance.  Most  standard  signifi-cance tests use 0.1 or 0.05 as a value to shoot for. Ourp-value  is  0.0004856  for  positive  score  and  0.0001766  fornegative  score  of  four  groups.  Hence,  ourp-values  comeunder  this  value.  Hence,  we  definitely  found  proof  ofvariance.  Now,  comparison  of  different  groups  can  bevisualized using Box plots (figures12and13).To confirm our one-way Anova, we have done one moretest,  i.e.,  homogeneity  of  variance  (Brown  Forsyth)  test.Thep-value here is 0.13 and 0.24 for positive and negativescore of four  groups, respectively,  which  is above  normalsignificance levels of 0.10 and 0.05 (tables8and9). Hence,this means there is no reason to disclaim ourF-test.4.3Evaluation of sentiment detection methodHere  sentiment  classification  effectiveness  has  been  mea-sured in two ways.4.3aCalculating precision and recall score:Now  the  sentiment  of  people  of  eight  cities  has  beenanalysed  over  the  span  of  two  months  using  lexicon  andmachine   learning   approaches.

The  classification  performance  is  evaluated  interms  of  three  measures:  precision  (P),  recall  (R)  andF-measure based on the numbers of true positives (TPs), falsepositives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). Precision can bedefined  as  TP/(TP?FP),  recall  =  TP/(TP?FN)  andF-measure or balancedF-score = 2(precisionrecall)/(pre-cision?recall).  Results  are  shown  in  table10.  The  pre-diction accuracy of a classification model is 70% for Naı ̈veBayes and 79% for SVM.4.3bCalculating citywide correlation matrix:After calculating city-wise total score per day from 08/11/2016 to 14/12/2016, a co-relation coefficient matrix amongthe  scores  of  eight  cities  has  been  calculated  (table11),which  indicates  how  accurate  the  sentiment  classificationis, and it shows to what degree the fluctuation patterns of asentiment are predicted by the model.5. ConclusionIn  this  paper,  we  have  tried  to  implement  a  dictionary-based  methodology  of  sentiment  analysis  and  analysedlarge amount of data to estimate the tweet sentiment of thepublic  in  the  aftermath  of  the  recent  ’demonetization’drive of the central government. We employed documentlevel analysis based on our own approach, which helpedinfer  opinion  and  sentiment  of  people  of  different  citiesover a five-week period. It is readily observed that whilethe  sentiments  vary  across  cities  over  time  or  acrossinterest groups, the impact dies down during the latter partof the period under consideration. While the academia andprint media reported concern about the adverse impact onGDP  and  growth  rate,  bias  against  the  poor,  informalsector  and  agriculture,  the  tweets  of  the  different  groupsdo  not  conform  to  this  view,  and  the  relevant  words  areseldom shown up in the tweets. The concern of the rulingpolitical  group  also  does  not  conform  to  the  primaryagenda  as  described  in  the  Gazette  Notification.  Thismethod  is  applicable  to  other  areas  also,  e.g.,  socio-po-litical events, customer review for public utility services,such as airlines or railways, etc., which immediately raisepublic sentiments.AcknowledgementsDas acknowledges the support from CSE-CSSSC ResearchProject   on   Capital   Market   funded   by   Calcutta   StockExchange.
